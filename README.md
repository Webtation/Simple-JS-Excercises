# Simple-JS-Excercises

Each simple excercise should be solved within 5 minutes.
Train them until all of them can be finished in under 3 minutes.

Many of the problems can be solved with simple for-loops.
While there is nothing wrong with for-loops, try to solve them with reduce.
Since most technical interviews focus on the reduce-function, drill the reduce function.

Be aware of the native reduce function in javascript.  Also, you might be provided a reduce function.
